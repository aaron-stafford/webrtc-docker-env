Dockerfile and scripts for building the x86_64 version of the official Unity
Webrtc plugin.

Requires approximately 40gig disk space.

# To install docker into a fresh environment (ubuntu) run the following
bash install-docker.sh

sudo ./run-debug.sh # To launch the image but not run the script.

sudo ./run.sh # To execute the script using the image.

The final webrtc-android.zip artifact built in the container will be available
in the "result" folder.
